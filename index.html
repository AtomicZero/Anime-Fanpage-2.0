          About Me:
        </h2>
        <p>
          I have been watching anime since the early 80s, staring with some legendary hits like, Battle of the Planets, Speed Racer and Voltron. At the time, we didn’t call it “anime”, that name didn’t come around till much later. Back then we called it “Japanimation” but I didn’t realise the difference between anime and regular cartoons till one fateful day in 1985 when I set my eyes on an anime series that would forever rock my world and launched my eternal appreciation for the media...and that anime was called <a href="https://robotech.com">ROBOTECH</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I’ve been watching anime off and on through the decades, experiencing highs & lows, likes & dislikes, europhoria & downright disenchantment with the genre!

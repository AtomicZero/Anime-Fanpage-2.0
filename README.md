# Anime Fanpage 2.0

This is my anime fanpage. Just to practice some of the basic HTML elements:
* Semantic HTML language
* HTML Nav tag
* Footer
* Image embed with caption and alt attribute
* Video embed from youtube
* Ordered List
* Unordered list
* Links to 3rd party site
* Links to other HTML files/pages
* Divs & Spans
* Tables 
* instyle CSS
* Custom background

## User Story
* I wanted to create an anime website that had multiple pages instead of one long page where you had to scroll a lot and the pages could be paginated or use a navbar or tabs
* I wanted my page to talk about my history with anime, how long I have been watching it, and describe some of the main categories and genres found in anime. 
* My page should be in semantic HTML and I also wanted my webpage to have working links to some of my favourite anime websites
* My page should also have a video of the Cowboy Bebop opening theme song
* I wanted my anime page to also have a list of some of my favourite anime titles and for there to be some images.
* All images on my page should have an alt attribute.
* I wanted to have a footer on my page with links to my MyAnimeList social media page.

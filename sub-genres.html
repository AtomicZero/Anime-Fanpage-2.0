          Since the early days of hitting the scene back in the 70s/80s, anime has departed from it experimental and
          exploratory phases to becoming a massive and mainstream establishment spawning several iconic world-renowned
          franchises and possessing a lot of sub-genres. Personally I loved when anime was new an experimental, it was a
          lot more thought-provoking and touched on a lot of topics that were deeply philosophical or even taboo [at the
          time of the anime release].

          The <span style="color: red;"><b>four</b></span> main sub-genres of anime are based on the general ages of their intended audience:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/shonen">Shounen</a>[young boys]</li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/shojo">Shoujo</a>[young girls]</li>
          <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga">Seinen</a>[older boys]</li>
          <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei_manga">Josei</a>[older girls]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Then these sub-genres are further cataloged by the usual entertainment categories: sci-fi, comedy, action, horror, romance, historic, fantasy, etc. There are some sub-categories unique to anime, however, such as: Mecha [giant robots] and Sentai [colour-coded heroes/squads] or those of a more mature level like, shounen-ai or ecchi
